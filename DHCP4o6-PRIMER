To play with DCHP4o6, you'll need to run both dhcp6c (DHCPv6 client) and
dhclient (as a DHCPv4 client).  A patch to ISC DHCP-4.3.3 is included
in this directory.  It should be easily applicable to other (similar) versions.

Then start the clients like the following example:

# dhcp6c c dhcp6c.conf -4 /tmp/dhcp4o6 en1
# dhclient -cf dhclient.conf -f /tmp/dhcp4o6 en0

dhcp6c.conf would like this:
id-assoc na 0 {};

interface en1 {
	  send ia-na 0;
	  request dhcp4o6-server-address;
};

dhclient.conf can be empty.

Of course, you may need to adjust interface names (en0 and en1 in the
above example) in a straightforward way.
